*Frosty Friday*, a series of weekly challenges released every Friday to practice and develop Snowflake skills, created by Snowflake users, for Snowflake users. 
Each challenge will be based on one Snowflake feature; from time travel, to pipes, from data transformation to streams.

All of the challenges will be SQL based, and some will even allow the option to use *Java*, and/or *Python*.
